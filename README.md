Imagine visiting a new town, and then coming up with instant plans such as attending that famous event in the town/ greeting some of your acquaintances/ visiting that famous tourist spot in the town but you hesitate, because you are heavy on luggage and most importantly... where will you keep it? You surely don’t want to rent out a hotel just to
keep your luggage safe for the day. All you want is someone who can take care of that extra luggage so that you can travel with peace. Most of us have already faced such problems while traveling.
In such scenarios, all we need is some temporary storage solution right in our neighbourhood where we can just drop off our extra luggage for a while. What if people around you are willing to take care of your luggage as their own belongings in exchange for some money?

Neighbour’s Storage is an app which provides GPS based listing of all such nearby temporary storage points.

Drop off your extra luggage at nearby households and shopkeepers who will keep your belongings safe at nominal charges.

In turn, city residents like households and shopkeepers can use the free space they have as a neighbour's storage point and make some passive income out of it.
